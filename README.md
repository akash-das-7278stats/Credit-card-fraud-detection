# Credit-card-fraud-detection
Credit card fraud costs consumers and financial companies billions of dollars annually and fraudsters continuously try to find new methods and tactics to commit illegal actions. Thus, fraud detection systems have become essential for banks and financial institutions to minimize their losses. This credit card fraud detection project is based on modeling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of ones that turned out to be a fraud. This model is then used to predict whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. We use  classification techniques for this project.
